My first attempt at raytracing, using raymarching. You can try it out [here](https://headmerchant.github.io/raymarch-v1/).

I originally wrote this shader in May 2020, but only published it in November 2020.

Web UI made with [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui) and [glslCanvas](https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/glslCanvas/).
